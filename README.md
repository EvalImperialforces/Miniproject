# Title: Miniproject
# Author: Eva Linehan
# Date: March 2019

This folder contains CMEE coursework relating to the Miniproject submission. All project work is arranged in the '**Data**', '**Code**', '**Results**' and '**Writeup**' folders.

The '**Data**' folder comprises of data files used for analysis. '**Code**' contains code used to execute data wrangling, analysis and plotting. '**Results**' contains all plots and figures generated as part of the Miniproject assessment and '**Writeup**' contains .tex files and related materials used in producing the final report.


###'**Code**' contains the following; 

1. 'run_MiniProject.sh'file
This shell script runs all code and LaTeX scripts to reproduce the Miniproject from start to finish. Bash version 4.4.19 is used in running this script.

2. 'Wrangling.py'file
This python script imports 'BioTraits.csv' to filter and subset data for model fitting before exporting the data as 'Ready_to_fit.csv'. 
Python version 3.6.7 is used, including NumPy and pandas libraries for data manipulation. 

3. 'Model_fitting.R'file 
This R script imports 'Ready_to_fit.csv' generated from data wrangling, and fits models to the data. 
The compiler package allows functions to be pre-compiled.
The package minpack.lm is required to perform non-linear least squares fitting for non-linear models. Model outputs are exported as 'Model_Results.csv' for plotting and analysis. 
R version 3.4.4 is used.

4. 'Plotting_analysis.R'file
This R script imports 'BioTraits.csv' and 'Model_Results.csv' to plot data and results. 
The compiler package allows functions to be pre-compiled.
The package minpack.lm is required to perform non-linear least squares fitting when fitting models to plotted data.
The package ggplot2 is required to create plots along with packages RColorBrewer, stringr and Hmisc which allow for colour and label customization in LaTeX-readable syntax. 
The package gridExtra and xtable are used to customize and convert tables to .tex files for LaTeX import. 
Packages dplyr, plyr and reshape2 are required to manipulate, aggregate and melt dataframes for data visualization.
All figures and tables are exported as .pdf or .tex files to the 'Results' folder.
R version 3.4.4 is used.

5. 'CompileLatex.sh' file
This bash script compiles .tex documents from LaTeX into .pdf format while performing a clean-up of assitional unwanted outputs.

###'**Data**' contains the following;

1. 'BioTraits.csv' file
Database containing standardized trait values, temperatures and other biologically relevant data that is wrangled before analysis.

2. 'Ready_to_fit.csv' file
The BioTraits dataset filtered and condensed, containing only data included in the analysis.

3. 'Model_Results.csv' file
Comma seperated file containing sample ID and related model outputs for plotting and analysis.


###'Results' contains the following;

1. Models_fitted' folder
Contains 1,577 figures generated from 'Plotting_analysis.R' in which models are fitted to each individual sample.

2. 'Appendix2.pdf' file
.pdf file that contains figure 2 in the Appendix of the final report.

3. 'Fig_2.pdf'
.pdf file that contains figure 2 printed in final report.

4. 'Fig_3.pdf'
.pdf file that contains figure 3 printed in final report.

5. 'Fig_4.pdf'
.pdf file that contains figure 4 printed in final report.

6. 'Fig_5.pdf'
.pdf file that contains figure 5 printed in final report.

7. 'Samples_boxplot.pdf'
.pdf file that contains figure 1 in the Appendix of the final report.

8. 'Table1.tex'
.tex file that contains table 1 printed in final report.

9. 'Table2.tex'
.tex file that contains table 2 printed in final report.

10. 'Table3.tex'
.tex file that contains table 3 printed in final report.


###'**Writeup**' contains the following;

1. 'crest.png' file
.png image used on coverpage of final report.

2. 'Miniproject.tex' file
.tex file containing report write up to be read and compiled by LaTeX.

3. 'References.bib' file
.bib file containing bibliography for final report.

4. 'Miniproject.pdf' file
.pdf file containing compiled final report.
